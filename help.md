# Flow Control: a programmer's text editor

## Terminal configuration

Most terminals have default keybindings that conflict with common editor
commands. I highly recommend rebinding them to keys that are not generally
used anywhere else.

For Kitty rebinding `kitty_mod` by adding this line to your kitty.conf is
usually enough:
```
kitty_mod ctrl+alt
```

For other editors you will probably have to disable or rebind them each
individually.


## Searching

Press ctrl+f to search this help file. Type a search term and press 
ctrl+n/ctrl+p or f3/shift+f3 to jump through the matches. Press Enter
to exit find mode at the current match or Escape to return to your
starting point.


## Messages and logs

Messages of issues regarding tasks that are not accomplished, like
trying to close flow with unsaved files, as well as other information
are shown briefly in the bottom status bar; most recent messages can
be seen in the log view too, to open it, use ctrl+shift+p > `View log`;
it's possible to make it taller dragging the toolbar with the mouse
up or downwards.


## Input Modes

Flow Control supports multiple input modes that may be changed
interactively at runtime. The current input mode (and some other
settings) is persisted in the configuration file automatically.

- f4 => Cycle major input modes (flow, emacs, vim, helix,...)

The current input mode is displayed at the left side of the statusbar.

- ctrl+shift+p or alt+x => Show the command palette

The command palette allows you to fuzzy search and select commands to run. It
also shows any available keybind that may be used to run the command without
opening the palette.

- ctrl+f2 => Show all available commands and keybinds

This shows all currently available commands. Including commands that are
normally only executed via a keybinding. Selecting a command in this view
will insert the command name into the current document instead of executing
it. This is very useful for editing keybinding definition files.

Run the `Edit keybindings` command to save the current keybinding mode to a
file in the configuration `keys` directory and open it for editing. Save your
customized keybinds under a new name in the same directory to create an
entirely new keybinding mode that can be selected with `f4`. Delete the
keybinding file from the configuration `keys` directory to revert the mode
to it's built-in definition (if there is one). Changes to keybinding files
will take effect on restart.

Keybinding modes may inherit all non-conflicting keybindings from another mode
by adding an `inherit` option to the `settings` section of the keybind file
like this:

```json
{
    "settings": {
        "inherit": "vim",
    },
    "normal": {
    ...
```

This allows you to make only minor additions/changes to an existing builtin
mode without copying the whole mode and is easier to keep up-to-date.

Additionally, individual sub-modes may inherit all non-conflicting keybindings
from another sub-mode of the same mode by adding an `inherit` option to the
sub-mode section like this:

```
    "normal": {
        "inherit": "project",
        ...
```

Multiple inheritance is supported with the `inherits` options like this:

```
    "normal": {
        "inherits": ["project", "tasks"],
        ...
```

### Flow mode

The default input mode, called just flow, is based on common GUI
programming editors. It most closely resembles Visual Studio Code, but
also takes some inspiration from Emacs and others. This mode focuses
on powerful multi cursor support with a find -> select -> modify
cycle style of editing.

See the `ctrl+f2` palette when flow mode is selected to see the full
list of keybindings for this mode.


### Vim mode

The vim modes, shown as NORMAL, INSERT or VISUAL in the status bar,
follow the basic modal editing style of vim. The basics follow vim
closely, but more advanced vim functions (e.g. macros and registers)
are not supported (yet). Keybindings from flow mode that do not conflict
with vim keybindings also work in vim mode.


### Helix mode

The helix modes, shown as NOR, INS or SEL in the status bar, follow
the basic modal editing style of helix. The basics are being adapted
closely, more advanced functions (e.g. surround, macros, selections,
registers) are not supported (yet). Usual keybinding with LSPs are
used for tasks like 'go to definition', 'go to reference' and
'inline documentation' featuring inline diagnostics. Keybindings
from flow mode that do not conflict with helix keybindings also work in
helix mode.

## Mouse Commands

Mouse commands are NOT rebindable and are not listed in the command palette.

- Left Click =>
        Clear all cursors and selections and the place cursor at the mouse pointer

- Double Left Click =>
        Select word at mouse pointer

- Triple Left Click =>
        Select line at mouse pointer

- Drag Left Click =>
        Extend selection to mouse pointer

- Alt + Left Click =>
        Add cursor at mouse click

- Ctrl + Left Click =>
        Goto definition of symbol at click

- hold Alt =>
        Enable jump/hover mouse mode

- Right Click =>
        Extend selection to mouse pointer

- Middle Click =>
        Close tab

- Back Button, Forward Button =>
        Jump to previous/next location in the location history

- Scroll Wheel =>
        Scroll

- Alt + Scroll Wheel =>
        Fast scroll

## Configuration

Configuration is stored in the standard location
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/flow/config.json`. This is usually
`~/.config/flow/config.json`.

The default configuration will be written the first time
Flow Control is started and looks similar to this:
```
frame_rate 60
theme "default"
input_mode "flow"
gutter_line_numbers true
gutter_line_numbers_relative false
enable_terminal_cursor false
highlight_current_line true
highlight_current_line_gutter true
show_whitespace false
animation_min_lag 0
animation_max_lag 150
```

Most of these options are fairly self explanatory.

`theme`, `input_mode` and `show_whitespace` are automatically
persisted when changed interactively with keybindings.

`frame_rate` can be tuned to control the maximum number
of frames rendered.

`animation_max_lag` controls the maximum amount of time allowed
for rendering scrolling animations. Set to 0 to disable scrolling
animation altogether.

File types may be configured with the `Edit file type configuration` command. You
can also create a new file type by adding a new `.conf` file to the `file_type`
directory. Have a look at an existing file type to see what options are available.

## Flags and options

As every respectable terminal program, flow provide various invoking
options that among others, will allow you to inspect various aspects of
the running session.  Feel free to run `flow --help` to explore them.
